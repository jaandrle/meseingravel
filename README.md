## 2. About
*The mod add new way to get mese crystals (mainly crystal fragments).*

At first you must add gravel block to a bucket with water (it is a craft recepy).
Now you only pour the bucket of a "watergravel" on a ground. But it is important 
to know that water will disappear if you place the watergravel on nonsolid blocks
(sand, gravel, dirt).

After a lapse of time you see yellow points on the
watergravel texture. You only dig the block and it drops mese a crystal fragment
(+ crystal fragment with rarity 2 and another with rarity 4 and mese crystal
with rarity 16).
